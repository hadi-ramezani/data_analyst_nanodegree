# D3_Visualization

This project is about creating an effective visualization on the ZillowPrize dataset (see https://github.com/hadi-ramezani/ZillowPrize for more details) using d3.js.

Feedback: 
-Colors are confusing
- Rescale the data
- Filter the data

All of these feedback and a lot more improvements have been applied to the visualization.
See different commits and the last version of the visualzation for the changes.
