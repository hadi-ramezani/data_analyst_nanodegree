# ZillowPrize_EDA

This project is an Exploratory Data Analysis for the kaggle competition "Zillow Prize: Zillow's Home Value Predition (Zestimate)". See https://www.kaggle.com/c/zillow-prize-1 for more details.

Step 1) Prepare the dataset

Note: you don't need to do this step if you have the file "zillow.csv" in the current folder (I already copied this file here). 
The script "prepare_dataset.Rmd" reads in the "properties_2016.csv" and "train_2016_v2.csv" (these files can be downloaded from the kaggle website), renames the features, and writes the dataset "zillow.csv". This is the dataset that the script "projecttemplate.rmd" will use.

Step 2) Knit the script "projecttemplate.rmd" to get the output.
